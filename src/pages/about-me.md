            <h2> Hello World!</h2>
            <p>My name is Ealynn Hsu and I'm a senior computer science & piano performance major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This is my UI portfolio to show off some projects I've been working on as-of-late and a place to store my ramblings about different articles I read discussing UI/UX-related topics. </p>
            <p>In my fourth year of university, I took a UI/UX course to learn more about the basics of interface design. Our main project was to create a website design for something we're interested in. I talk more about this project (Scrawl) in the "Projects" tab above, but this was such an exciting experience and taught me a lot about design via hands-on experience. </p>
            <p>Learning how to design has been a really fun experience for me that has allowed me to better understand my strengths and weaknesses
            with organizing information in an easy-to-understand format.  </p>
            <p>Thank you so much for visiting!</p>
