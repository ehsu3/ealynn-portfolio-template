# About Me

Hello! My name is Ealynn Hsu and I'm a senior computer science & piano performance major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This is my UI portfolio to show off some projects I've been working on as-of-late and a place to store my ramblings about different articles I read discussing UI/UX-related topics. Thank you so much for visiting.
