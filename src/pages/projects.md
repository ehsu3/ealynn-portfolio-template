## Scrawl
![Alt text](../../static/img/scrawl_login.png)

- Scrawl is an art social media platform for artists to share their interests in the arts with others with an intuitive and clean design that's easy to navigate and helps artists gain visibility and grow their audience. I worked on this project in collaboration with Katelyn Breitbarth. You can read a more in-depth narrative of this project and the steps involved in it on this [this](../scrawl_reflection) page, which is also linked below!
- While designing this interface, we wanted to insure that crucial art features, like a commissions page and organized DMs page, are included to allow for the smooth interaction between an artist and people who want to buy art.

### Design System
- Figma: [Design System](https://www.figma.com/design/bQ6iy1TsYJAkJRtRYxtTWr/scrawl?node-id=1-7&t=pGjro43KujStXEcw-1)
- One of the earliest steps for this project was creating a design system for the website, including many of the important assets and icons we'd be using throughout the development process. This is recorded and viewable via the Figma link above.

### Initial Mockups
- Figma: [UI Mockups V.1](https://www.figma.com/design/pDaIbX1vtbzajjhYeQxZoB/scrawl-2.0?node-id=0-1&t=TcjtbU9MeBIwwVQV-1)
- After creating a design system, we needed to make a rough mockup of what our site would look like and transform our initial sketches that had been done on paper into a more polished digital version. 
- As a note, for the mockups, we had to adjust some of the sizes of features of the original Design System, however, we wanted to keep note of how the design has changed over time so we have them stored in separate locations. 

### Interactive Prototype
- Figma: [Interactive Prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/doacDGNSpOWhEmGeNBL5Ro/scrawl-3.0?node-id=0-1&t=54vGGaLbBslWIwTa-1)
- The next step was to take the screens we created in our initial mockups and add some interaction to them, essentially, the ability to move between screens. This step, while tedious, became essential in our testing process to allow users to truly interact with the "site" so we could learn from how they used the site.

### Finalized Prototype
- Figma: [Final Prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/sife6gfHFYzVPmL5Oye0yW/scrawl-5.0?node-id=1-7&t=FF0LF5fU0abdLSje-1)
- After taking in user feedback from our colleagues and friends in the art community (two rounds of testing), we create the above version of the interactive prototype which now includes a couple of quality-of-life improvements, such as easier accessibility to the Commissions DMs page instead of only having one route to access them. 

### Project Reflection & Narrative
- Read Here: [Scrawl Project Narrative](../scrawl_reflection)
- After completing this project, we wanted to reflect on what we had created and the main learnings we had along the way. You can read more about these findings and the entire process of this project in the link above.
