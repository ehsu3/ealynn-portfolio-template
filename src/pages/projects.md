# Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **Project 1**: Scrawl: An art social media platform FOR artists, MADE BY artists. 
- **Project 2**: Description of your second project.

Scrawl: 
- Scrawl is an art social media platform for artists to share their interests in the arts with others with an intuitive and clean design that's easy to navigate and helps artists gain visibility and grow their audience. 
- Crucial art features, like a commissions page are included to allow for the smooth interaction between an artist and people who want art. 
- The Design System can be found here: https://www.figma.com/design/bQ6iy1TsYJAkJRtRYxtTWr/scrawl?node-id=1-7&t=pGjro43KujStXEcw-1
