# UI/UN Summit Reflection

Recently, I took part in an Accessibility Workshop to help young designers better understand the importance of making websites accessible and some of the challenges that are associated with that -- such as prioritizing different changes for different groups with varying needs. It's difficult to accomodate every strategy to make a website as accessible as possible since everyone has different priorities and needs that would make the website work better for a specific group but maybe worse for others. Finding a good balance of changes that help multiple groups is what designers should aim to do, but doing so can be trickier than one might think. 

For this activity, we were each tasked with becoming the spokesperson for a specific group of people with specific accessibility needs. Some examples are photosensitive individuals, baby boomers, and people with visual impairment. Each of us were tasked with figuring out the needs of the individual populations and the ways we could apply UI/UX techniques to design the best website for these groups. However, another element of this activity was that we were all working together to redesign a voting website and would need to negotiate certain UI elements that will assist our population's needs. To do this, we all came up with priorities for different elements of the UI (e.g. color scheme, navigation, etc.) and would have to debate each selection of needs that every spokesperson added to that section. We were given 20 points to split among the different parts of the site we wanted to prioritize and then that amount was cut to 15 and 10 points to see what really stuck to the UI in the end. 

My population was "People with Anxiety". I did some research to find out that people with anxiety often want assurance when navigating a website to know they're doing actions properly. Additionally, they like the ability to backtrack and "correct" answers on forms/check their work whenever possible. Some of my original recommendations were to inclue an FAQ/contact us page on the website, add a breadcrumb trail to help with easy navigation, and allow users to resubmit incorrect forms whenever necessary. 

During the negotiation itself, I mainly fought for features that would make navigation on a site easy. I feel like that need was the easiest to correlate with other populations since easy navigation really helps the general population. Specifically, working with the "new time voters (gen z)" spokesperson and the spokesperson for people with hand tremors -- we were able to make sure that easy navigation was prioritized on the site. Furthermore, one of the core recommendations I had, to allow users to resubmit forms, was highly supported as well by many groups. I didn't expect to find an allyship with the "Baby Boomers" spokesperson -- but foun they were really helpful in supporting that point specifically. However, it was a little harder to convince the spokesperson for "colorblindness" since they didn't see as much of a benefit from allowing resubmissions as other groups. It didn't feel great to prioritize certain needs over others, because it felt like a lot of the recommendations would've helped multiple populations but we just didn't have enough points to spread across every need on the slides. At the end of the day, I think we did a pretty good job priortizing specific needs and helping most, if not all, of the populations to some degree. 

I think my greatest takeaways from this were that helping create an accessible site isn't a matter of "cutting down features" or "making things simple and only use two colors", but really, it's just making a site easier to use for most people and keeping interfaces clean and organized. I think it'll be important to keep a lot of ideas that overlapped between populations (such as having clear navigation) in mind when designing future interfaces since what might help one or two populations, could also help the general public. A lot of different populations will have different specific needs, and the best way to learn about how to make your website more accessible, is to talk to these populations themselves, or if not, find people who know a lot about their needs and learn how to make your site more accessible. This was a really interesting activity that allowed me to learn a lot about how small changes to sites can really help make a website more accessible to many people.
