# Affordances and Signifiers Pt. 1: The Design of Everday Things

For this entry, I wanted to map the differences between two important terms in this section: affordances and signifiers. The author spends a significant portion of the chapter discussing how people confuse the usage of the word "affordances" to refer to the "qualities/properties" of an object when in reality, affordances refer to a relationship between a user and what they can perform with/on an object.

In the diagram attached to this post, I have created a Venn diagram with the differences between affordances and signifiers highlighted and some of the similar aspects between them. On the left, I emphasize that affordances refer to a relationship between an object and the user as well as a format that can be used to determine if something is an affordance vs a property, signifier, etc (this being: "[object] allows/is for [action]"). On the "signifiers" end, I explain how I think about the concept -- specifically how they are the visual/auditory/etc cues that inform a user on how to use or interact with an object/tool. In both halves, I include an example at the bottom using the example of a mug and what would be an affordance and what would be a signifier (+ what the signifiers signals) in that case. The center of the Venn diagram expresses that while the concepts are different, they have a couple of aspects that are similar -- such as their ability to be perceived (optional for affordances, necessary for signifiers) and unintentional (ex. for affordance: you're not supposed to throw a notebook, but you could).

The difference between these terms will be important to remember in my career as they will likely arise during conversations around the design of a product that a team is working on -- and being aware of the differences and how to use the terminology properly will allow me to contribute to conversations in an effective and accurate manner. It's important to be able to "talk like a designer" when in discussions around design, so being able to accurately refer to an affordance when discussing what a product/object should be used for vs what signifiers should be included in a product/object will be beneficial in those conversations.

I chose this image because it shows someone interacting with technology and how they're able to make connections between the computer port and the USB-C they have. Also, I think the little USB-C has its own affordances and signifiers (affords plugging in, signifies that it should be plugged in by having a matching end with the computer's port and having a little "hand-held area where the port narrows into the cord for fingers to hold).
