# User Tests

User tests help designers and programmers figure out the strengths and weaknesses of their UI design before they fully commit to developing and rendering a website. it is a way to quickly identify individual problems that might become exponentially problematic if not caught early.

Specifically, usability tests involve watching one person at a time try an action on your website/design/etc and see what steps they take to reach the goal (or if they even figure out how to reach the goal at all). These tests are invaluable in helping designers recognize errors in their workflows early on so that potential easy issues can be solved immediately instead of weeks or months down the line. For a designer, it's near impossible to get a fresh eye on their website personally since they've been so involved with the creation process. Trying to understand "other people's workflows" becomes incredibly challenging when one has been buried neck deep in the same set of workflow processes for so long. As such, getting an outside eye is a cheap, fast and easy way to catch major issues fast. 

To perform a usbility test, you'll need:
1. Find someone who is willing to spend 15-30 minutes trying out your site/design
2. A quiet place where you can record (either the conversation or the website's screen, or both!)
3. A couple of guiding statements to get the person started (e.g. this is a shopping website, please try to make a purchase of 3 apples). This is important as it gives the user a purpose when looking around the website -- similar to how they'd probably have a direct purpose when visitng your site.
4. Observe how the user navigates around the page without saying much. Ask the user to speak their thoughts out loud as they explore the pages and figure out what's going on.
5. Recap after the usability test to ask the tester if they have any general feedback (difficulty navigating certain areas). 
6. Thank the tester for their time! 

Usability testing is an incredibly easy and incredibly illuminating process that a handful of designers may look over as just "another test". However, they can be one of the most valuable experiences to get early feedback and inevitably create a better website!
