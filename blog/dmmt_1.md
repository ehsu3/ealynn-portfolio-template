# Don't Make Me Think: Designing for Spot Checks

Word: "Focus" 
Section: Chapter 3

I chose the word Focus because it represents how users interact with web applications -- they don't scan and analyze EVERYTHING on a given page, but instead focus on what stands out. Whether that be big, bold font or graphics scattered across the page, the job of a UI/UX designer is to help guide the user's eye to the important actions/tasks they might have to perform on a given page. Much like how different font sizes and styles are used in newspapers to draw the eye to different sections (e.g. having large text span 3 text blocks indicates that all three text blocks refer to the title above), a website's format should do the same. A few tips I learned from this reading about designing a web page are: 
- Create a hierarchy (the more important something is, the more prominent it should be on a page)
- Related topics should be related visually via blocking them together or unifying them under a title
- Websites are usually "nested" with the most important content at the top and the widest with everything else under and within it

Understanding the conventions used by people when reading webpages is important when it comes to designing them -- to make sure that your idea of how people should view a page is "standard". A good way to practice this is via interviews and user tests to see whether or not a user is able to accomplish directed tasks with no help (or if they click something COMPLETELY different). I didn't consider how important some "buzz" words could be to people when they scan webpages (e.g. free, cheap, money, etc) -- and how that might effect how people look at a page and what they focus on first. 

The word "focus" is important because, in my career, it will remind me to focus on directing user attention to certain focal points on a website instead of making it "pretty" or "aesthetic" without any visual indicators on what to look at.
