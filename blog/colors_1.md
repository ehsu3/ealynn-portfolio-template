One important part of getting into UI/UX is knowing how to communicate colors to an audience -- whether that's a product manager that you're recommending a color scheme to or some developers asking why you chose a particular color palette. As such, I think one of the most important parts of this section was learning how to "speak the language" of UI/UX designers when it comes to colors. As such, I wanted to outline a collection of the terms necessary when communicating color and examples on how to use them. 


- Hue: Synonym for different variations of a color (e.g. "hues of red" refers to different types of red)
- Value: The lightness/darkness of a color that depends on the amount of light the hue (color) reflects (high value = add white, love value = add black)
- Saturation: intensity of a color, how much/little gray it contains (e.g. plum is a desaturated purple
- Tint: a lightened color (e.g. pastels)
- Trace/Tinge: a small variation of a hue
- Tone: a pure color that's been modified by gray/black or white 
- Tonality: describes a color scheme
- Undertone: underlying color within a hue (e.g. blue in a gray-blue)
- Shade: modification of a pure color using black/gray
- Shading: effect of shadow on colors
- Palette: group of colors used to describe a theme


Colors can be used in a variety of ways to spark different emotions, similar to the effect different types of music can have on people (e.g. red is like rock music, something that gets you excited, while blue might be closer to r&b). Learning how to talk about these colors and use them when designing UI can be powerful in affecting people's initial impressions of a website. However, it's important to keep in mind that people have different perceptions of colors and color combinations -- so what looks good to you might not have the same effect on others. As such, it's important to get feedback on color combos before fully committing to one for an entire project.
