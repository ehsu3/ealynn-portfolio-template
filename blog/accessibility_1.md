Making designs inclusive for those with disabilities is often seen as an "extra" task piled on the plate of web developers and designers. Sometimes it feels like working on accessibility creates others problems for expressing a cohesive design story, when in actuality, the two often can work hand-in-hand. One of the biggest culprits for this misunderstanding can be colorblind users and website color schemes. 

"What if I'm a Christmas website, are you saying I can't use red and green?". This is often a common misunderstanding -- making a site accessible for those with color blindness often just means having colors that won't be confused used for selectinos or "checkmarks" and "x's" -- even having the symbols themselves in red/green buttons can be enough. You don't have to fully uproot your website's colors to account for people with colorblindness, you just have to be aware when creating contrasting points and sections throughout your site. 

Furthermore, "it's more work" is often the excuse developers use when needing to add more accessible components to sites, however, at the end of the day, what helps people with disabilities view a website can often help those without as well. Furthermore, a developer can prioritize changes that won't take the most effort but still have a big impact. One example of this is correctly using h1, h2, etc tags that can help a screen reader differentiate sections. Additionally, including "alt" tags for text can help people who use screen readers know more clearly what's on the page. But, to take that a step further, to really understand how vision-impaired people use screen readers, it's important to learn from them. Simply slapping on 100+ alt tags can be A: unhelpful and B: a lot of extra work for devs. Learning from users and applying what you've learned can help reduce the time spent working on a website and create a better experience for the users!

Accessibility isn't just about adding more and more details and complexity to a website to make sure it accounts for every issue under the sun, but simply making a website easier to use for as many people as possible. Designers and developers should keep this in mind when they're working on creating a new website for everyone to use as keeping track of these ideas earlier will make development down the line a lot easier to maintain and improve upon. Creating a website that's accessible to everyone is the job of every good designer and developer, and just something that's right to do.

It's important to make sure that things as simple as staircases keep others in mind (in this case, having two languages so a larger population can read the message and react accordingly)
