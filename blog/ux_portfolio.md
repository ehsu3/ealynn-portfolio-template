A UI portfolio is one of the most important ways for an aspiring UI designer to stand out in the recruitment process, having a place that displays and truly puts a designer's beliefs into concept is one surefire way to prove that they know what they're doing. Nothing shows credibility like putting your own ideas into practice. Additionally, a portfolio acts as a place to display all your best works -- whether those are case studies, projects, or work experience. So it's no small fact that making your UI portfolio look amazing is a necessity. Today, I looked through a handful of UI portfolio examples via the link listed down below and took note of the consistent factors each of them had that make them stand out. I've summarized those notes into a list of tips for designers to keep in mind when they design their portfolios. 

1. Consistency is key! 
I've definitely said this before but I truly think it's one of the most important things designers need to rememeber when they design ANYTHING. Humans love repetition and having a consistent color scheme, set of fonts and font sizes, iconography, etc. is imperative to keep people interested and invested in your site. It also has a hand in making your work look more professional -- which is always a plus in the grand scheme of thing. Being able to keep a UI page consistent so that people are able to easily navigate it and find what they need (e.g. your previous works, blog posts, etc.) is important. 

2. Be okay with using white space!
I'm guilty of trying to avoid having too much white space on a resume or a paper in fear that people will think I have no experience or little to say, but sometimes having white space is a plus. It helps keep pages clean and organized without looking too cluttered -- something UI designers are desperately trying to avoid in their works. Being liberal with your use of white space can help a home page feel more professional and lighter to use and explore so that people don't get stuck trying to read all the information on the home page and never go off to find the other aspects of your portfolio. A good way to offset having more white space is making sure each word on that page has a meaning or a statement to make. For example, if you're listing your different works, having a title that isn't just 2 or 3 words, but instead, a sentence, can help draw people in more than just saying "Fast Food Website". Instead, you could say "Redesigning a fast food chain's web application for ease of use" or something to get a point across on what you were able to accomplish via the project. 

3. Figure out your Design Goals
Each of the portfolios has something different to say -- some people want to come across as clean and minimalistic if they want to work for a company with similar ideals while others want to come off as fun and lighthearted if they want to work for a company in entertainment that might want their works to be more uplifting. Finding this design goal and creating a portfolio around that is imperative. This can be shown through the choice of font (Times New Roman may come off as more elegant than something like Comic Sans) or your choice of thumbnails. Images make lasting impressions on people so choosing images that suit the purpose of your portfolio and look good next to each other is really important! So remember, find those design goals you're trying to achieve via your works and stick to them!

The process of designing a portfolio is similar in the sense that you have to think through what will look good and feel good before you start developing it.
