When people think of the word "constraints", they are probably thinking of a negative connotation, specifically that constraints are what prevent creativity, freedom, or something of a similar concept. However, constraints in the terms of design and even social norms can often have a positive connotation. Without constraints, it would be very difficult to separate "right" from "wrong" actions, specifically in a social setting, and in the terms of design, knowing what's "expected" to base your own website's layout after. In short, constraints are your friend, they provide a way to measure and understand social and design-based conventions and can help you determine a proper course of action given any situation where that direction might be needed. 

There are four main types of constraints that you're probably passively aware of even if you've never separated them as such. These are: 
1. Physical constraints. Physical constraints are like having pieces of a puzzle that only fit into one location, no matter how hard you shove them elsewhere, they only have one place to belong and that's what allows you to  figure out the whole of a puzzle over the span of a couple of hours... or days depending on the puzzle size. These are often the easiest constraints to understand and react to since they physically won't allow you to take another action or try anything differently. However, there are some physical constraints that have less of a purpose than others, while some may help you orient complex mechanisms in the right direction, others, like batteries having a positive and negative pole are born out of "legacy" -- meaning they've just been the way they were at the start for so long that people have come to view them as the standard.
2. Cultural constraints. These are probably the constraints we're most familiar with, the ones that cause you to get flushed with embarrassment when you drop a fork in a restaurant or laugh too loud. Cultural constraints are what different cultures allow and expect in certain social situations, they're often learned via experience and through social interaction. However, this means that unless you've been immersed in the culture for long enough, you likely don't have access to this "secret handbook" and may appear awkard to others who know. Learning and being aware of cultural constraints wherever you are is important and often helps determine how we act in social situations.
3. Semantic constraints. Semantics is the study of meaning, meaning that semantic constraints are how you use knowledge of the situation and the world to make decisions. For example, understanding what different lights on a car indicate helps you react to a car braking or indicating that it wants to turn. These are, similar to cultural constraints, in the sense that you pick them up over time or via learning from someone you know. They're really valuable and often  ingrained when we start to make decisions. 
4. Logical constraints. Have you ever taken something apart to put it back together and realize you have a couple of extra pieces? Well, that's a logical constraint. Simply, you have to ask yourself "something must have went wrong, I shouldn't have an extra piece" which will lead you to reconsider your process and what you did to get to the current "completed" state. This re-evaluation is how you interpret the constraint and may shape your future actions.

So, constraints aren't all that bad. They help us make decisions and while they can cause embarrassment and stress at times, they're mostly helpful in getting people to decide what to do next and what actions would be wise. They're our secret handbook to understanding people and devices and the closest we'll ever get to a comprehensive instruction on how to be human.

Photo by https://unsplash.com/@alanrodriguez on Unsplash -- Legos are a great way for kids to understand how to follow directions and their intro to physical constraints (trying to put certain legos that don't belong together doesn't always work when trying to build a specific set). It fits this topic perfectly as it's an example of something that has some physical constraints when used.
