# Preparing for UI Interviews

I watched three videos to learn a little more about how UI interviews work and how they differ from the types of interviews I've done in the past (mainly for QA or SDE positions). For the most part, the behavioral section remains relatively the same -- with questions about who you are, why you chose the path you're on, and your strengths/weaknesses. In answering these, the videos suggested practicing your answers ahead of time so that you're able to react quickly and speak concisey. When talkin about past projects, the videos continued by encouraging you to keep the initial response concise, framing the response as: the challenges you faced on the project, your solution to them, and the impact of your involvement on the project. Keeping the details neat and concise can allow the interviewer to dig into what they want to hear from you instead of talking through very specific details they may not care as much about. 

One interesting fact I was not aware of was the commonality of asking "what framework do you use when designing" - since I didn't learn many of these via this class, it would be important to learn the popular types used in industry so that I could apply that in the interview and talk about my usage of them. Being able to show that I'm aware of these typical frameworks would be important in showcasing my knowledge of the design process. 

In terms of preparation before the interview, the second video specifically mentioned researching the company and the types of projects they're working on. Doing this can help you learn a lot about the company and potentially how you should frame your answers to their questions. Additionally, this video highlights the importance of confirming that your portfolio has all the required skills from the job posting somewhere withn it -- so that designers who are considering you will be able to see those skills highlighted in recent projects. 

The last section of the videos was the most unique to UI/UX interviews specifically -- the 'Design Challenge' or 'Case Study Presentation'. As far as the Design Challenge goes, it looks like it's mainly an opportunity for someone to show off how they design outside of the office and how they approach a problem. The second video recommends practciing via websites like Interview Warmup and also being sure that you IDENTIFY the problem before trying to design a solution. He said that one mistake junior designers make is trying to design a solution without fully identifying and understanding the problem. 

The last video was a senior designer talking through her interview process -- which may relate less to me but still has some good tips for more involved and in-depth interviews. For example, she mentioned having to prepare a case study presentation on something she designed in the last 2 years. She recommends having about 3 case studies on your portfolio to show off your understanding of your project and what you did well/what you would improve now. In preparation for this presentation, she reocmmends practicing it out loud instead of in your head -- as it's a skill similar to singing -- you don't know how well it'll come out unless you practice out loud. Being able to communicate clearly and explain your designs in-depth is an invaluable skill and can help showcase your strengths in a clear way. 

All three videos had great advice for UI interviews or interviews in general -- I think my main takeaway is the importance of being able to explain the projects in my portfolio in-depth, especially talking about the challenges and solutions we came to during it. Additionally, I think if I were to pursue UI/UX positions, it would be important for me to refresh my knowledge on design processes and common patterns so that I'm able to answer more general questions in a well-informed manner.

This feels like it could be very fitting for this reflection since it shows an interview which is what we're preparing for.
