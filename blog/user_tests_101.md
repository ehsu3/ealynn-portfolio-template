Understanding the Need to Test:
A significantly challenging part of designing a website is that different people are bound to have different opinions on how a website should look and act and it's impossible to make everyone happy with just one design. In the case of a business where a new website is the job of a whole team to decide upon, figuring out the design priorities among developers, PMs, the designers, and business management can bring in a slew of troubles. The designer might want to prioritize feel and appearance while the business may be more concerned about how clearly their message gets across, even at the sake of making the page look "empty" or "ugly" to others. There are ways for these positions to all work together, but that all starts with clear communication and a willingness to "check feelings in at the door". This website might be a prie for the whole team, but advising changes on sections you may have devoted a week of time to is just part of the process. Avoiding words like "I really like BLANK, everyone loves BLANK" is just a surefire way to get arguments from those who don't like BLANK (fill in BLANK with any website feature, e.g. dropdowns, complicated image displays, etc). This is often referred to as a "religious debate" where people state strong opinions without budging, leading to a lack of decision-making and a never-ending stalemate. 

As such the best way to figure out what an "average user" wants (note, there is no "average user" - but it's the term many refer to when they talk about their userbase and how they might interact with a product) is to perform some user tests! Get people who might use your website in the future and see how they interact with it. 

Testing: 
Figuring out tests can be difficult, but primarily, there are a couple of types that are helpful at different stages of a project. For example, "focus groups" are a great way to get quick information before the development of a product as to what people might want. In a focus group, people discuss a given topic and come up with suggestions for a potential application. For designers, this is a great way to get a starting point on features that they might need to design in the future. Usability tests are performed after some initial development/prototyping has been done, and provides a platform for users to interact with the application properly. In these tests, you give a user a couple of prompts of actions they should try and perform on the website and observe what they do and what they don't do. This can help you as a designer figure out what's "easy to interact with" vs what may be less natural. Usability tests are probably the best way to parse for good feedback on what may need to be changed for a given website. 

Root Causing:
Root causing is the process of finding out what cause a particular error/misdirection in a user's actions. Of course, this is YOUR problem and not the user's to solve. In a way, the user is always right and it's the design that didn't clearly communicate intent to that user. The main question to ask yourself when a user acts differently than you expect them to, is "WHY". Why did they choose that action vs another?

There are a couple of ways to identify types of "incorrect" actions. A "slip" is when someone takes an action you don't expect -- these actions are often ones that need to be heavily analyzed as they tend to be a result of users not knowing what to click (which is something you should investigate as a designer). A "mistake" is often what occurs when a goal is incorrect or the plan to achieve that goal is wrong. While this can sometimes occur when a user doesn't know what to click, sometimes it's a result of not having clear instructions as to their main goal -- make sure you're giving them detailed and direct prompts to follow! And lastly, there are "errors", which occur when someone is unable to accomplish an expected step in the "Seven Stages of Action" cycle. It's important to figure out what stopped a user from taking the next step so you can analyze it an decide what might need to be changed to allow them to make each necessary step to accomplish a prompt.
