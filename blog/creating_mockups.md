We have our ideas in mind, we have thoughts on designs, but how do we pull everything together? I read a couple of chapters that really break down the ideas into concepts that can be applied anywhere -- from making mockups of an application or designing presentation slides from scratch. 

Let's start at the very beginning, a great place to start. First, when we are getting ready to design anything, it's important to keep in mind that it is not a one way street, there will definitely be moments where you feel like everything looks bad and you should start over but maybe, before you throw that draft into the trash, take a step back. Go on a walk and get away from the work. As much as everyone wants to be productive every minute of every day, it just isn't possible and any good employer knows this. Taking a break, going on a walk or simply getting a clear head by taking a 20-minute power nap is sometimes the reset people need to look at something with fresh eyes. 

Another tip when you have a design in hand is to try and add a couple of constraints. People hate constraints but sometimes they can help us think more creativity by allowing us to think in a new way that we wouldn't be challenged to think from the perspective of if it wasn't for the constraint. Don't see them as an enemy when they can often be a friend in spurring new ways to be creative in a project. For example, there's a method when it comes to designing presentations, where you try and use 20 slides which are each shown for 20 seconds -- how can you maximize the information you share in an interesting way with these constraints? This will often help keep messages brief and slides easy to read -- both great aspects to have when preparing a presentation. Just remember: Simplicity, clarity, and brevity when it comes to designing things that will be shown for a short period of time!

So, now that we're ready to design, how do we... use the space in the best way? In technology, when you visit a website, you don't try and stay on a page too long -- as such, home pages have to be able to really catch your attention and draw it to your next destination. Different aspects, like headings, logos, messages, etc all fight for space on the home page, making it imperative that you split the real estate effectively. Ask yourself from any page: "What is this?" "What do they have?" "Why should I be here and not somewhere else?" and "What can I do here?". These questions can help you figure out if you'r missing an important aspect on your page -- such as a navigation bar that might help people get to new places. Another fun feature to have is a tagline and welcome blurb which will inform the viewer of what the site's purpose is in a quick way. However, don't mistake a welcome blurb for a place to put your mission statement -- keep that to your "About Us" page. A welcome blurb should be like the intro you give someone before you let them see your house -- it's a nice welcome mat that helps welcome them to your site. And lastly, a secret fifth question to ask is "Where do I start?", so you can make sure that people who are visitng for the first time know where they should be looking to get started doing anything on your site. 

When it comes to design, sometimes it can be really easy to forget that the audience wants a reason to pay attention -- and sometimes that isn't achieved through blocks of text and information. I would love if my attention span worked like that and let me absorb all that information, but unless there's a story, sometimes it's easy to zone out. Humans are drawn into stories, they love hearing events in an order and a direction and this can be achieved well in presentations and on websites. What is the story you're trying to get your audience to follow as they go through your site? Earlier in your design, you probably created some "user stories" so let's let the people live that experience via your site's navigations, the colors, etc. Every element should help serve the purpose of sharing that story. In a more traditional powerpoint presentation, a story is something that can be conveyed through the slides that links them together. Sometimes this is something literal, like telling the history of a certain event, but sometimes this is more abstract, like a "concept" that is carried from start to finish. In any case, being able to weave a "journey" through slides keeps people interested in listening to you talk about it without them getting distracted or zoning off. Bring EVERYTHING to that core method when you design and maybe experiment with designing away from a computer. I know we love slide templates and just copy-pasting elements we need, but sometimes sitting down to storyboard an idea out without a template can help you create a very memorable presentation that people will remember in the future.
