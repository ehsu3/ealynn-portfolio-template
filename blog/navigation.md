# Don't Make Me Think

Navigation is an important part of the online experience which often goes overlooked. However, it plays an important role in making sure people know where they are in a space that doesn't physically exist. At times, it's like asking someone to figure out where they are in a dark room with zero sense of where they are and how to get anywhere. Without a navigation system being integrated into the site, people don't know where they are in the expanse of individual pages.

Unlike navigating in real life, where we have a map of a building or a handy Google Maps on our phone -- the digital space is, conceptually limitless, and if you're new to a site, it's unlikely you know how many pages there are or how they all connect. Which is good in the sense that it makes the site seem weightless and makes it easier to navigate to new pages and backtrack if you realize you're looking in the wrong direction. But this can also be exhausting if you really don't know how to get to a particular page you want to view. A search bar can help narrow down the expanse of this searhc -- however, sometimes it doesn't get you from point A to B fast enough and clicking around aimlessly does a better job. 

"You are here" navigators or breadcrumb trails can also help people conceptualize where they are in an online space, allowing them to backtrack easily if they realize they're looking in the wrong spot. Having these show up at the top of a screen with differnet coloring, styling, font, etc for the page a user is on can help them figure out where they are on a site and how they got there. This is really useful in sites that have multiple layers of pages -- such as shopping websites where you might have to look through multiple categories to figure out what you want to buy. 

At the end of the day, testing how well the navigation system works is imperitive and can be done by getting to a random page on your site and asking the following questions: 
- What page am I on (what is the name of the page)? 
- What are the major sections of the site (e.g. navigation bar, header that has the different pages listed)? 
- What can I do at this level/page (where can I go, what can I do, etc)? 
- Where am I overall ("you are here" or breadcrumb indicators)? 
- How can I search (is there a search bar)?

The second reading by Colin Breck focuses on figuring out personal core values and how to share them with others. Brene Brown believes the best leaders have strong core values that they follow and practice day-to-day that guide them in their leadership role and in their life. Figuring out these core values can help people become better leaders and stronger people overall, giving us a few driving motivations. The process to figure out these values initially is as follows: 
1. Find a list of 100+ values (there's one listed on the website)
2. Start crossing out values that aren't incredibly important to you till you're left with a handful 10-20
3. Organize these core values into a couple of groups (3-4)
4. Try and find main values that the rest of the values can fit around till you're left with 2 core values surrounded by associated values
5. Create a sentence for each of these values that expresses why they're important to you. 

Now that you're left with these two values, try and apply and practice them in your lives. One great way to do this is to share them with others. This helps them understand you better and if they're willing to share as well, helps you understand them. It's a great way to demonstrate vulnerability and solidify the values in your personal life. Learning to do this can help you become a better leader and give you more direction in your life.
