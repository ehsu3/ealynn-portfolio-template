This chapter gives a quick overview of some important design elements and concepts to keep in mind when working on designing something (in this case, presentations, however, the tips apply to most things a UI/UX designer would be charged with creating). While reading this, I kept my future project in mind -- knowing that these would likely be concepts I'd want to check my website design against to make sure that it is incorporating these ideas effectively and prevent "clutter" from arising on my website.


I wanted to take this time to review some of those important tips that I learned and how I intend to apply them to my work. 


First, I had to realize and internalize that design is not something that comes last, it's not even something chosen at the last moment before you start adding information to slides, just to get a fun template for your class presentation. Design is a "thought process" of sorts, it's a way of thinking that aims to simplify and reduce the difficulty of a viewer to understand and interact with your work (e.g. slides, a website, etc). This way of thinking helps check and double-check that your work is easy to read and understand in an "aesthetically pleasing" way -- but a pleasing way that doesn't require layers of decorations and "noise" that just get in the way of the message. 


On the topic of "noise" -- the "signal vs noise" ratio is a great way to try and understand how busy a website is and if it's getting the point across easily. To test it, take a look at a website and figure out what information you can gather from the page. How easily you're able to get that information while also taking note of some "pointless" decorations, headers, etc can be a good way to figure out the signal vs the noise. In my case, the first example that comes to mind is the difference between the Storygraph and Goodreads profile pages. Both are book-tracking websites for readers, but Goodreads emphasizes shoving a lot of information on a user's profile but in a less effective way via many graphics, subheadings that are hard to read, etc. So while it DOES show more information than the profile page of Storygraph, it does it in a messier way -- making the signal-to-noise ratio of Goodreads lower than that of Storygraph, which clearly conveys the main pieces of information a user might need without looking too cluttered -- making use of some of the empty space to add clear divisions between sections on the page.

Another concept I learned was to use images to their full potential -- simply that users remember photos more than they will big blocks of text or bullet points on a slide. This was interesting to me since I feel like I've always been told to use bullet points to break apart information when presenting -- but photos seem to be where it's at. Not only does it give a visual element for the user to connect with, but it also brings the focus of the conversation back on the speaker instead of on the slide (which is usually the goal of a presentation, despite that making it more difficult for the presenter since they'll have to know their topic better that they can talk off an image and not just bullet points). 


And lastly, the "Big Four": contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. These seem like pretty simple concepts upfront since well, to maximize simplicity, you want high contrast, high repetition (of elements between pages), alignment (placement on a page), and proximity (keep similar things close) -- but altogether, they really help bring a design together and are just a good "checklist" of things to notice and walk through before you finalize a presentation slideshow or a website design. I think, most importantly, keeping cohesive elements between pages (repetition), narrowing focus (contrast, proximity) and looking professional (alignment) are the main goals of these four concepts and they're each achieved in different ways. 


It will be really exciting to start applying all these concepts directly to the sketches I'll have to do for the upcoming project.
