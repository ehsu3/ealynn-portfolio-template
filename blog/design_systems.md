Designing a design system is probably one of the trickiest parts of creating a website. Figuring out the "standards" that the entire site will abide by is a lofty task that is 1: difficult to create and 2: hard to stick by for every detail. In this blog, I'll walk through some of the major tips I've learned that can act like a bit of a checklist whenever you need a point of reference while working on that new design system. 

1: Consistency is key. The point of a system is to standardize and define constructs to be used throughout the entire site. These ideas need to be consistent and reused to allow for a seamless and unified experience. Having 17 different font sizes and 30 colors is just a perfect way to mess up someone's perception of a site in a couple of seconds. Having a unified front makes the website appear more professional and "put together". When you're checking consistency, make sure to take a look at: colors, font sizes (H1-H6), vertical spacing, and how you define borders. 

2: Vertical Spacing: This is something that's easily overlooked but very important in making a website look consistent. Making sure that a consisent scale is used between different areas of text or imaging can be a great way to add an air of professionalism to a site. This could just be using a scale of "8" so that the space between font/images scales up by 8 each time (8, 16, 24, etc) or maybe size 4 to account for more variety in sizing. This will just help the site appear more uniform from afar even if you can't tell the difference personally -- a little change goes a long way in this case and it's something to definitely do a quick check of before publishing your website. 

3: Types of layout scaling. People don't all have the same screen size, let alone the same device in which they'll be using your site. Creating a website that can scale to fit any screen is a good way to appear more professional to those who might use your site. There are a couple ways in which this can be accomplished though. Adaptive means thatt as your screen size grows, the format of the page changes, a section might move downward or be removed entirely. Responsive means that the different text areas or features grow and shrink with the changing format of the page, still keeping different information in the same sections of the page but now they scale appropriately wih the screen size. And lastly, strict which is not an option I recommend in most cases -- in which the content on the page stays fixed regardless of the screen size, making people scroll to view more information on smaller screens. Regarldess of the layout scaling chosen -- just make sure to be consistent throughout!

In conclusion, there are a lot of decisions to be made when deciding on a design system and working out some of the intricacies but it's a rewarding process that, at the end, will give you a site that's clean and easy to use, allowing for a seamless and enjoyable experience for any users that will keep them coming back in the future. 

A few last minute tips before I round out this post: 
- Add consistency to the capitalization of headers (e.g. capitalize each words vs just the first in a sentence)
- Be consistent with the vocabulary used throughout the site (e.g. "Delete" vs "Discard" -- pick one unless you want them to be distinct)
- Add and maintain confirmation dialog for important/significant actions on the website to give users more flexibility to "turn around" if they need to
