# Color Meaning vs Color Personality

I think it's an interesting concept to try and view favorite colors as an implication of a person's personality and/or interests. Not only does the approach feel a bit hard to digest at first (how can you determine personality based on color in the first place?) -- the meanings of the colors themselves (in the earlier section) usually are multi-faceted, making it difficult to tell what about that color can be shown via a personality. For instance, red can symbolize anything from power to danger to love to passion, which all seem like high-energy emotions/concepts but that's their only shared value. Same with green being a warm color but also being associated with jealousy. As such, if the "meaning" of colors is already so inherently split among multiple meanings -- how can we derive a cohesive set of personality traits from them as well? I think learning a little more about the thought process between some of the colors' meanings and their "personality meanings" would be a really neat conversation to have. 


But I am not all critical, when I tried the "color personality quiz" on myself, the answers turned out to be mostly correct. I really like pinks, blue-greens (turquoise), and lavender, and I could take a little from each of those sections that matched me partially but maybe not completely. The results give the vibe of "take what you want to manifest, leave the rest" -- where some aspects may relate in part, but not necessarily in full. Out of the options, I think the section on "pink" resonated with me the most, with blue-green and lavender only being partially true. The MBTI quiz enjoyer in me thinks this is a really cool idea and would love to test it on some other friends to see if the same results hold up! 


And of course, to circle back to the section on color meanings, I feel like a couple of these are "well-known" to the point that everyone is like "Yeah, red is passion and yellow is sunshine and happiness" -- but this text took that to a deeper level, examining what could be the cause for these associations in the first place and how there are many variations to meaning in a color, some of which aren't always positive. It'll be important for me to keep these colors and their meanings in mind when developing the final project so we choose colors that inherently match the message and theme of our website.
