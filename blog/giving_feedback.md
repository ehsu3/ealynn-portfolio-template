Chosen Word: Growth

Giving and receiving feedback can feel really uncomfortable. Whether via an internship or at work, getting feedback on something you have been pouring your soul into to make it perfect can feel disheartening, especially if feedback is given in the wrong way. But giving feedback is DIFFICULT, whether it's coming up with the opinions that is challenging or figuring out a nice way to give feedback, both make the overall task very challenging. However, there are ways to make giving feedback more painless, which I'll talk about here.

1. There are two types of feedback, pick which you're trying to give. Reinforcing feedback means you're encouraging someone to continue a behavior and is the easiest feedback (in my opinion) to give. It's like a pat on the back for something people have done, but still feedback nonetheless. The second type is redirecting feedback, which is when you want someone to change a behavior or a part of their work. This is DIFFERENT than negative feedback, which consists of just telling someone to stop a behavior or remove something -- redirecting feedback gives the person a place to go to and redirect their focus to, allowing them to productively update what might need to be changed or discuss it with you if they really value their choice. Redirecting feedback feels less like a "shut down" of someone's idea, and instead a suggestion to go in another direction -- leaving room for cordial conversation or discussion on the topic. 

2. Focus on giving feedback on one thing at a time. Not only does this keep the conversation focused and allow someone to really zone in on correcting or switching up an action -- it's also the best way to help get goals accomplished and keeps the person receiving feedback from getting overwhelmed by getting multiple suggestions at once. 

3. Point the feedback at a design, not the designer -- people aren't perfect, emphasize that you're trying to redirect efforts on a certain module and not toward the actual developer/designer themselves.

4. Create a culture of feedback. Feedback is a skill that can be learned and is invaluable in helping people improve their own works and collaborate on difficult tasks to get the best results. Often, negative feedback causes people to become distant and seek out positive feedback, but using redirecting feedback and creating an environment where people are excited to ask for feedback or advice on their current project can help normalize the general "uncomfort" of giving feedback. When people are willing to listen and know you care for them when  you give advice, it makes the experience all the more fun and enriching.

5. Lastly, try and give feedback at regular intervals so that designers know when they'll be receiving feedback and it'll feel more like a normal process instead of something suddenly out of the blue that hurts or feels really admonishing toward them. I know, from personal experience, that getting feedback regularly is better than having someone suddenly call you out for something that you didn't realize was an issue. Nothing hurts more than unsolicited feedback. Having regular meetings where you can receive feedback and begin applying it helps people grow and keeps the pressure off the feedback "giver" to find a "good" way to give feedback. Giving them the space to give feedback and for people to receive it helps make everyone in the situation more comfortable. 

Feedback is difficult to give, but at the end of the day, all of these tips are linked back to the idea of growth. Growth of the giver and receiver so that they can both improve their skills and how they convey feedback to others. Showing that by giving feedback, you're just trying to help the other grow is the most important thing, help them feel valued and they'll take the feedback to heart and apply it!

I think, while this feels like more "personal feedback" (girl evaluating how her day was) -- it still applies to the idea of giving and receiving feedback.
